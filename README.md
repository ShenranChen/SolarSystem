# Welcome to the mini solar system

Used spheres to create planets <br />
Used cylinder to form Saturn's ring <br />
Added a plane of stars for the atmosphere <br />
Uploaded images to create the individual material for each planet <br />
Each planet rotates around the sun <br />
Has two C# scripts (one that rotates the planet to mimic day, second that rotates around the sun to simulate year)
